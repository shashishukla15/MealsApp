# MealApp

This repository contains a project on Meals-App which I made for Skill Test of Coding Ninja. Coding Ninjas Skill Test Frontend Project Group 2

About the Project :-
This is a single page website where you can seach about any meal.

You can also add it into on your favourite list.

The most important thing about this project it is fully responsive of nature and use an api called the themealdb to fetch all the dishes.

It also redirects users to a youtube videos for the recipe of dishes.

Features
Home Page Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as you type, the search results should update). Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list). On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal (meal page).
